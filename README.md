# Week-9-Honeypot-Project

Which Honeypot(s) you deployed?
I deployed Ubuntu - Dionaea with HTTP

Any issues you encountered?
Yes, I had to redo Milestone 2 many times as it was giving me errors and not going through.
In milestone 3 I was able to deploy the honeypots, it was success but I could see the attacks but the attack report was empty as you can see in the gif below:

I had issues with exporting data as Json, it didn't allow me to go through the links, it gave me below error:

I tried alternate method but still it didn't allow me to view it, but I was able to download the file. My attacks were 6394 but the exports still were 0.

A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.
The number of attacks are as in the screenshot below, I couldn't view the attack report so I tried to create another honeypot and work it out but it doesn't work. I don't know what is causing the problem.

My nmap results are as below:

Any unresolved questions raised by the data collected? Yes, I had a fatal error for geoloc, I don't know how to fix it and I think that is the reason I am not able to see the attack report. I couldn't figure out why I am not able to get attack report, stats and export json file.
