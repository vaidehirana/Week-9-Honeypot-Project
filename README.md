# Week-9-Honeypot-Project

Which Honeypot(s) you deployed?
I deployed Ubuntu 14.04/Centos 7 - Dionaea, Ubuntu - Shockpot

Any issues you encountered?
Yes, I had to redo Milestone 2 4-5 times as it was giving me errors and not going through.
In milestone 3 I wasn't able to deploy the honeypots, it was success but I couldn't see the attacks. It stayed at 0 and I am still trying to figure it out
