# Week-9-Honeypot-Project

Which Honeypot(s) you deployed?
I deployed Ubuntu 14.04/Centos 7 - Dionaea, Ubuntu - Shockpot

Any issues you encountered?
Yes, I had to redo Milestone 2 many times as it was giving me errors and not going through.
In milestone 3 I was able to deploy the honeypots, it was success but I couldn't see the attacks. The report was empty as you can see in the gif below:
