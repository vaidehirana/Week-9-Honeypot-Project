# Week-9-Honeypot-Project

Which Honeypot(s) you deployed?
I deployed Ubuntu - Dionaea with HTTP

Any issues you encountered?
Yes, I had to redo the whole project in order to view the attacks and export the data, there were few problems as below and I couldn't find what? I created a new project and was able to get the attack report as well as the json file.
In milestone 3 I was able to deploy the honeypots, it was success but I could see the attacks but the attack report was empty as you can see in the gif below:

I had issues with exporting data as Json, it didn't allow me to go through the links, it gave me below error:

I tried alternate method but still it didn't allow me to view it, but I was able to download the file. My attacks were 6394 but the exports still were 0.
