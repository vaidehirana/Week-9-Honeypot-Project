# Week-9-Honeypot-Project

Which Honeypot(s) you deployed?
I deployed Ubuntu - Dionaea with HTTP

Any issues you encountered?
Yes, I had to redo Milestone 2 many times as it was giving me errors and not going through.
In milestone 3 I was able to deploy the honeypots, it was success but I couldn't see the attacks. The report was empty as you can see in the gif below:

I had issues with exporting data as Json, it didn't allow me to go through the links, it gave me below error:

I tried alternate method but still it didn't allow me to view it, but I was able to download the file. My attacks were 6394 but the exports still were 0.
